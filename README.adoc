= Creating a RESTful web service with IntelliJ

NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to create a REST service on Open Liberty with IntelliJ.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to get started with IntelliJ by building and testing a simple REST service which will expose
the JVM's system properties. The REST service will respond to `GET` requests made to the
`\http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties` URL.

This guide is similar to https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html#creating-the-jax-rs-resource[Creating a RESTful
 web service] but will focus mainly on the IDE.

== Installing and configuring IntelliJ

If IntelliJ isn't installed, download and install it on your machine. The free community edition will suffice for this
guide.

== Getting started

Launch IntelliJ and select `Get from Version Control` and paste the following in the `URL` field:
`https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-IntelliJ.git[^]` and select `Clone`.

Make a note of the directory path that the project is being cloned to.

When prompted if you would like to create a project, select `Yes`. On the `Import Project` dialog, choose `Import
Project from external model`, select `Maven` and click on `Finish`.

You should see a progress bar indicating the status of the operation. Click on `Open` on the welcome screen and
navigate to the directory that the project was saved and select `Ok`. On the top left hand side of the screen,
expand the `guide-{projectid}` project.

The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The `finish` directory contains the finished project that you will build.

At the bottom right of the IDE, click on `Terminal` to bring up the console if needed. By default, it should start
in the `guide-{projectid}` directory.

== Configure the build project

From the menu bar, select `Run` and click `Edit Configurations`. Click the `+` button at the top-left in the
 `Run/Debug Configurations` pop up window. Select `Maven` in `Add new configuration`.

For the `Name` and in `Command line` field, put `liberty:run`.

For the `Working directory` field, select the path or navigate to the `finish` directory. 

Once again, click the `+` button at the top-left in the `Run/Debug Configurations` pop up window. Select `Maven`
in `Add new configuration`.

For the `Name` and in `Command line` field, put `liberty:stop`.

Finally, click the `+` button at the top-left in the `Run/Debug Configurations` pop up window. Select `Maven`
in `Add new configuration`.

For the `Name` and in `Command line` field, put `liberty:dev`.

For the `Working directory` field, select the path or navigate to the `start` directory. 

Click `OK` to save changes.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, you can select `Run` in the menu bar and click `Run...`. Select `liberty:run`
in the pop up window and deploy it to Open Liberty.

The tool window will be activated by default displaying a console which allows you to follow the progress of the build.

Check out the service at the
http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties[^] URL.

Select `Run` in the menu bar and click `Run...` and then select `liberty:stop` in the pop up window.

You can also use the icons on the toolbar to toggle quickly between the different configurations that were set up
above.

== Creating the application

On the top left hand side of the screen, expand the `guide-{projectid}` project and navigate to the `start` directory
to begin.

Select `Run` in the menu bar and click `Run...`. Select `liberty:dev` in the pop up window which will start the
Open Liberty server in development mode and will listen for file changes.

== Configuring the server

To get the service running, the Open Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

== Building and running the application

The Open Liberty server was started in development mode at the beginning of the guide and all the
changes were automatically picked up.

Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties[^] URL.

== Debugging feature

You may wish to debug the program. After you run `liberty:dev` you can attach the IntelliJ debugger to the Open Liberty
process.

From the menu bar, select `Run` and click `Edit Configurations`. Click the `+` button at the top-left in the
`Run/Debug Configurations` pop up window. Select `Remote` in `Add new configuration`. Type 7777 into
the Port field and click OK to start the debugger.

Open the class `PropertiesResource` in the editor and click in the margin on the first line of the method
`getProperties()`. This will set a breakpoint on that line.

Now refresh the browser at the http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties[^] URL. The server will stop at
the breakpoint you set and you can examine the state of your JVM. Click Resume Program to continue testing your
application.

== Testing the service

You can test this service manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the
http://localhost:9080/LibertyProject/System/properties[^] URL. Automated tests are a much better
approach because they trigger a failure if a change introduces a bug. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client
API provide a simple environment to test the application.

You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server, or they
can be written to call the application server directly. In this example, you will create a test that
does the latter.

EndpointIT.java
[source, Java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=comment"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/rest/EndpointIT.java[]
----

This test class has more lines of code than the resource implementation. This situation is common.
The test method is indicated with the [hotspot=test file=0]`@Test` annotation.

pom.xml
[source , xml, linenums,role="code_column"]

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in development mode at the start of the guide, press
`enter/return` key to run the tests. You will see the following output:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.884 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.rest.EndpointIT

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

To see whether the tests detect a failure, add an assertion that you know fails, or change the existing
assertion to a constant value that doesn't match the `os.name` system property.

When you are done checking out the service, exit development mode by selecting `Run` in the menu bar and clicking
`Run...` and then selecting `liberty:stop` in the pop up window. Alternatively, type `q` in the shell session where
you ran the server and then press the `enter/return` key

== Great work! You're done!

You developed a REST service in Open Liberty using IntelliJ.
